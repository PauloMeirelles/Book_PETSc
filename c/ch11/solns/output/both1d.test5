  ---------- Testing Jacobian -------------
  Run with -snes_test_jacobian_view and optionally -snes_test_jacobian <threshold> to show difference
    of hand-coded and finite difference Jacobian entries greater than <threshold>.
  Testing hand-coded Jacobian, if (for double precision runs) ||J - Jfd||_F/||J||_F is
    O(1.e-8), the hand-coded Jacobian is probably correct.
  ||J - Jfd||_F/||J||_F = 4.39397e-09, ||J - Jfd||_F = 7.82275e-09
done on 5 point grid (eps = 0.01, limiter = centered, jac_limiter = centered)
numerical error:  |u-uexact|_inf = 6.0192e+00,  |u-uexact|_2 = 5.7845e+00
